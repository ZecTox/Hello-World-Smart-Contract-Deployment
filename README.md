This is my First Smart Contract Code written in Solidity and I also Deployed the Smart Conrtract on Rinkeby Test Network with the help of Metamask (for Test Ethers), Alchemy (Helps like an API and connects us directly to Blockchain so we can save our time to code more to connect to blockchain) and the last one is Hardhat (Which helps us in compile contracts and run them on a development network).
